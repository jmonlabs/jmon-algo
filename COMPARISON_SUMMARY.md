## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ MIDI Key Signature Detection (FIXED)
**Location:** `src/converters/midi-to-jmon.js:387`
**Status:** TODO → **Implemented**

**Implementation:**
- Added `extractKeySignature()` method that parses MIDI meta events
- Added `midiKeySignatureToString()` helper to convert MIDI key format to musical notation
- Supports both major and minor keys
- Handles sharps and flats correctly
- Returns format like "C", "Gm", "Bb", "F#m", etc.

**Code Added:**
```javascript
extractKeySignature(parsed) {
  // Checks header and all tracks for key signature meta events
  // Returns earliest key signature found
}

midiKeySignatureToString(key, scale) {
  // Converts MIDI key format (-7 to +7 for flats/sharps)
  // And scale flag (0=major, 1=minor)
  // To string like "Dm", "G", "Bb", etc.
}
```

### 2. ✅ Ornament Duration Validation (FIXED)
**Location:** `src/algorithms/theory/harmony/Ornament.js:42`
**Status:** TODO → **Implemented**

**Implementation:**
- Added `parseDuration()` static method to parse both numeric and Tone.js notation
- Supports formats: numeric (1, 0.5), Tone.js ('4n', '8n', '2n', '8t', '4n.')
- Validates minimum duration requirements for ornaments
- Returns clear error messages when note is too short

**Code Added:**
```javascript
static parseDuration(duration) {
  // Parses '4n' → 1 (quarter note)
  // Parses '8n' → 0.5 (eighth note)
  // Parses '2n' → 2 (half note)
  // Supports triplets ('8t') and dotted notes ('4n.')
}

// In validateOrnament():
if (ornamentDef.minDuration) {
  const noteDuration = Ornament.parseDuration(note.duration);
  const minDuration = Ornament.parseDuration(ornamentDef.minDuration);
  if (noteDuration < minDuration) {
    // Error: note too short
  }
}
```
