    # `jmon/algo` User Guide

    Welcome to the `jmon/algo` user guide! This library provides powerful tools for algorithmic music composition, generative music, and live coding.

    ## Getting Started

    1. [Live Coding with jmon/live](live-coding.html) - Interactive real-time music composition

    ## Coming Soon

    More guides will be added covering:
    - Introduction to jmon/algo
    - Harmonies and scales
    - Sounds and synthesis
    - Loops and patterns
    - Minimalism techniques
    - Random walks
    - Fractals
    - Genetic algorithms

    ## About jmon/algo

    `jmon/algo` is a JavaScript library for algorithmic music composition. It provides:

    - **Music Theory**: Scales, chords, harmonies, and progressions
    - **Rhythm**: Isorhythms, timing utilities, and pattern generation
    - **Generative Techniques**: Minimalist processes, fractals, and genetic algorithms
    - **Live Coding**: Real-time pattern updates with jmon/live integration
    - **Score Rendering**: ABC notation and sheet music visualization
    - **Audio Playback**: Integration with Tone.js for high-quality synthesis

    Start with the [Live Coding guide](live-coding.html) to see what you can create!
